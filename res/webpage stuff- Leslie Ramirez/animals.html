				<p>Parakeets love to interact with their owners and entertain themselves 
				inside their cages with toys. Outside of the cage, a T-stand or playpen 
				makes a good home away from home.
				Your pet bird loves to preen and clean. Offer him a warm bird bath 2-3 
				times a week, 
				or a refreshing mist from a spray bottle.
.</p>
				<p>Reassure your parakeet in a calm voice and with slow movements.  
				Talk to him and he’ll soon talk back to you.  As his trust in you grows, 
				he’ll even learn to talk your language.</p>
